	<h2> [Intro] x2 </h2>
	<span class="lyricsChunk">
		Someone's out there<br>
		Waiting for me<br>
		I have to find her<br>
		And tell her that<br>
		I love her<br>
	</span>

	<h2> [Verse 1] </h2>
	<span class="lyricsChunk">
		You're a million miles away<br>
		The bridge between winter and summer<br>
		Seems like a bummer but it's worth the wait<br>
		And I know you'll shine the way<br>
		With your lava lamp (lava lamp)<br>
		In the middle of your room<br>
		From my window I could see<br>
		Bright blue light was shining deep<br>
		Like the sea on New Year's Eve<br>
		Wishing you were next to me<br>
		Yesterday in LA<br>
		It was sunny but it rained<br>
		In my room (in my room)<br>
		When I wrote a song for...<br>
	</span>

	<h2> [Chorus] x2 </h2>
	<span class="lyricsChunk">
		Someone's out there<br>
		Waiting for me<br>
		I have to find her<br>
		And tell her that<br>
		I love her<br>
	</span>

	<h2> [Verse 2] x4 </h2>
	<span class="lyricsChunk">
		If only<br>
		You'd hold me<br>
		And I wasn't<br>
		One billion miles away<br>
	</span>

	<h2> [Chorus] x4 </h2>
	<span class="lyricsChunk">
		Someone's out there<br>
		Waiting for me<br>
		I have to find her<br>
		And tell her that<br>
		I love her<br>
	</span>
